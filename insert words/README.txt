what insert_words.py does:
    - It'll ask you for a text file to look at (e.g. "example.txt")
    - In that file, it'll find all the things inside curly braces and
        ask you what you want to replace the curly braces with.
    - After it finishes getting all the input, it will make a new file
        in the same location as the scriptwhose name is the same as the
        original file with " - changed" appended.

how to make it work:
    - You might need to install python (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
    - Make sure insert_words.py and example.txt are in the same folder
    for mac users:
